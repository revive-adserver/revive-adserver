Few additional notes about WinCvs :

In order to use WinCvs you need the application WinCvs.exe and
the dll's, plus :

1) tcl81.dll. Refer to http://www.scriptics.com.

2) "cvs.exe" is based upon cvs 1.10 code. It is a little
bit different than the Cyclic one because it has some hacks
usefull for WinCvs (dirty files mainly + some extras fixes).

3) You need to set-up some environment variables in
order to use cvs.exe in a dos command (unused by WinCvs) :

HOME : the location for cvs to find global settings files
(.cvspass, .cvsignore, .cvsrc)...
PATH : needs to point out the WinCvs folder.
CVSROOT : your CVSROOT.

4) If you use it WinCvs in "client" mode (means your cvs
repository is accessed thru TCP/IP) and your server is a cvs-1.9
server, you need patch.exe.

5) All the others exe are used in local mode only.

Note (8/20/98) : If you got some problems with the files patching,
please update your server to cvs-1.10. Later versions of WinCvs
don't support anymore cvs-1.9.

Enjoy !
