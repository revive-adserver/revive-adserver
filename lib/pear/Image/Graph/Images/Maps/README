In this folder the files for the Image_Graph_Plot_Map are located. They should be the
following format:

[map name].png
[map name].txt

The [map name].png (fx. europe.png) is the actual image presenting the map. The 
[map name].txt file is the location -> (x,y) conversion table. In this file the
named locations is written on every line with the x and y coordinates after the
name (with a TAB), i.e.:

Denmark	10	30
England	4	30

Where Denmark will be 'located' on (10, 30) on the map, and England at (4, 30).

No maps are released by default due to we want to avoid possible copyright issues.
