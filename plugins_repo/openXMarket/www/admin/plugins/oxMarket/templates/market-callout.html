    <p><b>Earn more money with OpenX Market</b></p>
    <p>
        OpenX Market enables advertisers to bid competitively to show their ads on your site.
        If the highest bidder exceeds your specified CPM, OpenX Market will serve the ad and pay you
        the higher revenue. Otherwise, your campaign's existing ad will be delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
        We recommend that you specify a CPM that represents the effective CPM that you
        expect to get from your campaign.
