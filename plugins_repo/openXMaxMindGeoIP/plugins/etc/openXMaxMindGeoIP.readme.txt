This plugin provides support for using one or more MaxMind database files to
to perform viewer geo-location data lookup & targeting.

The plugin includes the free MaxMind GeoLite Country database; if you wish to
perform geo-location based targeting using any of MaxMind's other databases, you
will need to purchase the relevant database(s) from MaxMind, upload the database
file(s) to your server, and then use the "Settings" link above to configure the
plugin, so that it can locate the relevant database(s).

Note: The included MaxMind GeoLite Country database path does not need to be
configured in the "Settings" above; it will be used by default. However, you can
override the "Country" database in the settings to specify either a more up to
date version of the free MaxMind GeoLite Country database, or a paid-for
version of the database with greater accuracy.

Note: The included MaxMind GeoLite Country database is the May 2014
release.
