Known Issues
------------

This list covers some of the known problems with OpenX ${RELEASE_VERSION}. Please
read this before reporting any new bugs.

 * The upgrade process may time out with very large databases. See the FAQ
   [http://www.openx.org/help/${RELEASE_MAJOR_MINOR}/faq/large-db] for more information if you
   have a large database.

 * OpenX ${RELEASE_MAJOR_MINOR} requires PHP 5. If you are using PHP 4, you will need to
   update your web server to use PHP 5 before upgrading.

 * If you want to run OpenX with MySQL, please note that OpenX ${RELEASE_MAJOR_MINOR} requires
   MySQL 4.1 or higher. If you are using an older version of MySQL, you will
   need to update you database software before upgrading.

 * If you want to run OpenX with PostgreSQL, please note that OpenX ${RELEASE_MAJOR_MINOR}
   requires PostgreSQL 8.1 of higher. If you are using an older version of
   PostgreSQL, you will need to update your database software before
   upgrading.

 * Some of the PEAR libraries used are not compatible with database prefix
   names with double "_" characters (e.g. "ox__"). You should NOT install
   OpenX with a prefix of this format.

 * Some users have reported issues of being logged out when viewing
   statistics. This can be worked around by ensuring that the timezone is
   correctly set in PHP
   [http://www.openx.org/help/${RELEASE_MAJOR_MINOR}/timezone-settings].

 * See [https://developer.openx.org/jira/] for the latest bug reports.
