This is a test framework for MDB2 built using PHPUnit.
These tests directly access the MDB2 API - hopefully this framework
should give better feedback as to where or what caused when error are encountered.

Usage:
In order for the tests to work they need to access a database called
"driver_test". This database is created using the MDB2_Schema test. If you have
problems running these test or the driver you are using does not yet
provide the necessary methods you may create the "driver_test" database manually:

CREATE TABLE "files" (
  "id" int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
  "document" longtext,
  "picture" longblob,
  UNIQUE KEY "lob_id_index_idx" ("id")
);

CREATE TABLE "users" (
  "user_name" varchar(12) default NULL,
  "user_password" char(8) default NULL,
  "subscribed" tinyint(1) default '1',
  "user_id" int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
  "quota" decimal(18,2) default '0.00',
  "weight" double default '0',
  "access_date" date default '1970-01-01',
  "access_time" time default '00:00:00',
  "approved" datetime default '1970-01-01 00:00:00',
  UNIQUE KEY "users_id_index_idx" ("user_id")
);

To setup the tests

* requires PHPUnit to be installed

* requires MDB2 (with the given driver) to be installed
  in a php include path.

* copy the file test_setup.php.dist to test_setup.php

* edit test_setup.php. The array $testarray specifies which testcases
  to carry out. $dbarray is an array of databases to test.

* point your browser at test.php or your CLI at clitest.php for the results,
  and then fix the bugs!

* by default test.php/clitest.php will use all tests in the testcases - if
  you want to pick specific tests, use testchoose.php to pick just the
  tests you want to run

Writing tests:

The tests are written using PHPUnit from pear so first make sure you
have the latest stable release, and have read the docs,
http://pear.php.net/manual/en/packages.phpunit.php
